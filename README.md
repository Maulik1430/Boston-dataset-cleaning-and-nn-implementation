# Boston Housing Dataset – Data Cleaning & Neural Network Implementation

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides a complete demonstration of building a regression model using the Boston Housing dataset. It covers the full machine learning lifecycle, from raw data preprocessing to training and evaluating a neural network. The project is designed with clarity and modularity in mind, making it easy to understand each stage of the pipeline.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `dataset_cleaning.py`  
  Responsible for preparing the raw dataset for modeling. This includes data inspection, handling missing or inconsistent values, feature scaling and normalization, and creating clean training and testing splits.

- `nn_implementation.py`  
  Implements a feed-forward neural network for regression. This file defines the model architecture, training and validation loops, loss computation, and performance evaluation.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Proper preprocessing is a critical step in this project. The dataset cleaning module ensures that all features are numerically stable and suitable for neural network training, which helps improve convergence and overall model performance.

## 🧠 Neural Network Model
The neural network learns complex relationships between housing features and target prices using the processed data. Model training is monitored through loss metrics to evaluate learning effectiveness.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate best practices for organizing machine learning projects while highlighting the importance of clean data pipelines, feature engineering, and neural network-based regression.
